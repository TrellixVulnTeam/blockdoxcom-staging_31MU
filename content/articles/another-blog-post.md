The closer you are to an person infected with Covid-19, the greater the risk becomes of being infected yourself.  Thus it is important to maintain a 'safe' distance between people to lower the risk of infection spreading.  

This safe distance is known as "Social Distancing".  By maintaining a safe distance from others, the rate of infection should slow, making the outbreak more manageable whilst a vaccine is being developed over the course of the next 12-18 months.

The WHO have suggested that a minimum distance of 2m from each other, is maintained.  It is generally believed that in the event of someone coughing or sneezing, Covid-19 will not transmit from one person to another as particles will not reach much further than 2m.  

However, some evidence suggests that a safe distance would actually be between four and six metres :

Professor Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) [used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as six metres](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852).

She is critical of the current safety guidance: "Having this false idea of safety at one to two metres - that somehow drops will just fall to the ground at that distance - is not based on what we have quantified, measured and visualised directly."

A [study undertaken within hospitals in China](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885_article) found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, and estimated that four metres is a more appropriate safe distance.
